<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Thilini, a mechanical engineering student at the University West in Sweden. Originally from the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, I spent nine years working at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka from 2013 to 2022. I hold an EMSc in Finance and am an associate member at the Institute of Bankers Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>I have one brother who lives in Sri Lanka. I am living with my husband in Gothenburg Sweden. We have been happily married for seven years now. His name is Sameera Dahanayake and he works as a chef in a pub in Gothenburg.</p>
<p>Meet our furry friend, Dogzer, who currently stays with my mother-in-law back in Sri Lanka. During my free time, I enjoy reading, watching movies, and experimenting with new recipes. I also love traveling and make it a goal to visit at least one new country every year. So far, I've been to Austria, India, Thailand, and Singapore.</p>
