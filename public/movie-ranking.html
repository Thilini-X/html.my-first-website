He is eventually sent to a boarding school where he meets an art teacher named Ram Shankar Nikumbh. Nikumbh recognizes Ishaan's artistic talent and the underlying issue of dyslexia. The teacher then takes it upon himself to help Ishaan overcome his learning difficulties and discover his true potential. This is my third favourite movie of all time.</p>
